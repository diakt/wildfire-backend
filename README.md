Comments:
I need to wean down both the feature numbers and the point numbers
I could go by state, but that would exist at some risk.

What I want:
Location (in lat/long)
CalculatedAcres
FireDiscoveryDateTime
DiscoveryAcres
PercentContained
ContainmentDateTime
ControlDateTime
FireOutDateTime
DailyAcres

How would I do this?
Seed by request.
